## ZTM Course Exercise: Web App APIs

This took quite awhile to figure out mostly because of the logic behind it
but after tons of google searching and console.logs managed to create this simple app using a shorten link public api [link to api](https://shrtco.de/docs/).

I didn't use any frameworks, this was just made with plain html, css and javascript. I'm sure anyone could improve this using react and your own api endpoints ect.
